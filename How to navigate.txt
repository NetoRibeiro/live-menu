App Launch / Home: The user starts here (implied, we can design this if you like!).
Category Selection Screen: From the Home/Start, the user lands on this screen, where they choose a main category (e.g., "Dinner").
Sub-Category Selection Screen: After selecting "Dinner," the app transitions quickly to this screen, showing sub-categories like "Appetizers," "Main," "Dessert."
Product List Screen: The user selects "Main" and is taken to the product list, displaying individual dishes with their details and video placeholders.
Navigation:
From any screen, the "Home" button instantly takes the user back to the Category Selection Screen.
The "Back" button allows the user to return to the previous screen (e.g., from Product List to Sub-Category, or Sub-Category to Category).
This flow ensures the user always knows where they are within the three-level hierarchy.
